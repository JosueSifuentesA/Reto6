# Time Management Viewer
This is a simple web-based application that displays information about the user's time management habits. The application allows the user to select whether they want to view data on a daily, weekly, or annual basis, and then displays the corresponding data from a predefined object.

# LIVE DEMO
https://josuesifuentesa.github.io/Time-Tracking-Dashboard-with-Javascript/

# Usage
To use the application, simply select the time period you wish to view from the dropdown menu at the top of the screen. The application will then display the corresponding data for that time period in the main section of the page.

The data is sourced from a predefined JavaScript object, which contains information about how the user has spent their time on a daily, weekly, and annual basis. This information is updated regularly to reflect changes in the user's time management habits.

# Design
The application features a simple, minimalist design with a focus on ease of use and readability. The user interface consists of a single dropdown menu and a main section for displaying the selected data.
